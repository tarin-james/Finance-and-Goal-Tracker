# Overview

This project was created to further my previous knowledge using c#. It has been a while since I used it, so I decide to make a pretty large project to remind myself how to use it. I Had to use a lot of help from the C# documentation site, but in the end it works.


The software that I wrote give the user 8 different options to choose from a menu. In those options, the user can write a financial or lifetime goal, and track their spending or income. 


I wrote this software to become more familiar sith c# after it had been some time.
